There are some awesome algorithms out there that produce incredible visualisations. This repo deals with a number of algorithms in Q, solves them, and plots them using my brief wrapper of [GNU Plot](https://github.com/sbruce1/q-plotter)  

## Algorithm Shortlist

This is the shortlist of algorithms I want to solve and create animations for, open to cool suggestions.

- [1D Heated Rod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_equation) (just to get into the swing of things again) **[Done](1DHeatedRod.q)**
- [Rayleigh–Taylor Instability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh%E2%80%93Taylor_instability) **[Done](Rayleigh-Taylor.q)**
- Top Down [Rayleigh–Bénard Convection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh%E2%80%93B%C3%A9nard_convection) (unsure if can fully 2D)
- 2D [Navier Stokes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations) for a variety of starting conditions
- [Cahn-Hilliard Equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cahn%E2%80%93Hilliard_equation)
- [Kuramoto–Sivashinsky Equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuramoto%E2%80%93Sivashinsky_equation)
- [Swift Hohenberg Equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift%E2%80%93Hohenberg_equation)
